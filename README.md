# iOSFibonacciDrawing

## Proof of concept application: Run the app on the simulators, your iDevice, or in the playground(if you want to move the code into a .playground file)...

Files in this project are well commented! Model (Fibonacci.swift): Includes the Fibonacci sequence algorithm, and a reverse negation method of the sequence. View (FibonacciView.swift): Inlcudes our code for invoking our Fibonacci.swift methods, and literally drawing the models data. Controller (ViewController.swift): Not much going on in there, just hide that top bar mess.

Notice in the Main.storyboard, I've just set the class as FibonacciView.
