# iOSFibonacciDrawing

## Run the app on the simulators, your iDevice, or in the playground(if you want to move the code into a .playground file)...

// These files are super well commented!...

Model(Fibonacci.swift): Includes the Fibonacci sequence algorithm, and a reverse negation method of the sequence...
View(FibonacciView.swift): Inlcudes our code invoking our Fibonacci.swift methods, and literally drawing the model data...
Controller(ViewController.swift): Not much going on in there, just hide that top bar mess...

Notice in the Main.storyboard, I've just set the class as FibonacciView...
